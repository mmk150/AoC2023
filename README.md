# Advent of Code 2023

This currently is my repository for code and solution sketches to the [2023 Advent of Code problem/puzzle set](https://adventofcode.com/2023/). Advent of Code is a yearly [advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar) of daily programming puzzles, with difficulty that generally increases over time on a day to day basis: the earlier problems are significantly easier than the later ones.

Solutions written in Rust and Python, at the moment.
